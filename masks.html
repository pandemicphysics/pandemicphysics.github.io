            <h2>Mask Use for COVID</h2>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has put the use of masks into the public spotlight. Contrary to large parts of East Asia, where masks were commonly used when ill, the UK had to react to COVID-19 without any meaningful prior societal use. Much has been reported about how effective masks are, the uptake of mask wearing and what type of mask is best to wear. How can a knowledge of physics help us understand what masks do and decide if compulsory mask wearing is a necessary course of action? Interestingly, common physical concepts such as Brownian motion, electromagnetism, Newtonian mechanics and our understanding of the exponential function are key in any such evaluation.
        </div>
        <div class="sectionB">
            <h2>COVID-19 Transmission</h2>
            Firstly and most simply, we recognise masks as a barrier to COVID-19 infecting individuals. A major spread of COVID-19 is through the air, travelling from one person's mouth and nose into another person's mouth, nose or eyes. We must address what our coughs, sneezes, talking and breathing produce in terms of droplets expelled into the air.</br>


COVID-19 is on the scale of around 0.15μm [1] but is carried in larger droplets of water expelled out of the mouth and nose from either coughing, sneezing, breathing or talking. These droplets are of scale 0.1μm-1000μm in diameter [2]. Notably, breathing throughout the day can produce roughly the same number of droplets through the day as coughing and sneezing do over the same period. Sneezing can produce ~10^4 droplets with velocities up to 20m/s whilst coughing produces 10-100 times fewer droplets with half the peak velocity of sneezing [2]. Talking produces around 50 particles every second but at much lower velocities.
</br>

Importantly, we can separate the sizes into three regimes: the smallest of less than 0.3μm, the medium particles of 0.3μm-0.6μm and the largest at anything over 0.6μm. Each regime travels through the air in very different ways- all described by notably different physics. Here we model a typical sneeze from an infected person in terms of these droplet regimes.

</br>
The largest particles have sufficient momentum to travel out in the direction of the sneeze, with the very largest (>10μm) falling to the ground within a metre [1]. Whilst they have sufficient momentum to travel in an intuitive Newtonian like motion, we must be careful to remember how small these particles are. Settling times for a 3m fall are roughly 10seconds for 100μm, 4minutes for 20μm and an hour for 5μm [3]. This information should change how we envisage a sneeze dissipating through the air- infectious droplets of any sizes can be present in the air without another member of the public nearby.

</br>
The medium sized particles are identified as the hardest for masks to create a barrier against (see the Physical models of droplet capture page). These particles are massive enough for air molecule collisions to be negligible but not so massive as to travel in straight lines. Instead, these particles follow air currents and can remain airborne for many hours.

</br>
The smallest particles are light enough to interact with air molecules so will collide many times on very short time scales, hence following "Brownian motion", where the path of the particle is random. The collisions with the air molecules can leave these particles airborne nearly indefinitely [3].

This short animation shows a simplified example of Brownian motion. We have our "air" particles in red and our "COVID-19" particle in the centre. The vectors show how collisions, highlighted using yellow explosions, change the trajectory. For half of the animation we see the air particles and for the other half we focus only on the motion of our COVID-19 particle. It is clear that the COVID-19 particle cannot efficiently travel in a certain direction and passes through the same points many times. In reality there would be many hundreds of collisions each second, making it very difficult for the COVID-19 particle to displace itself from a prescribed origin. We can describe the displacement from the origin mathematically using the Weiner process and produce a distribution to show us where the COVID-19 particle is most likely to be. Instead of giving a proof of what distribution Brownian motion follows, a simple python code of the Weiner process, or "random walk" function, is used.

</br> For each step of one in the x-direction the lines move up or down randomly by one in the y-direction. Some will be displaced just by chance far from the x-axis, where they all start, but most will remain close to it. This is much like the well known description of probability using a coin flip- 100 flips can technically produce 100 heads but the most likely outcome if 50 heads and 50 tails. This type of plot is known as 'stochastic', meaning it's well described by a probability distribution. By plotting a histogram of the y-value where each line ends up on we can infer the most likely position for our particle to be in from the animation- the origin. The histogram shows what is called a Gaussian, or normal, distribution. Knowledge of this motion is highly relevant- even just thinking about a mask as a simple kind of "netting" we see that collision with air particles cause these small particles to pass through the fibres many times, strongly increasing the chance of capture.

        <h2>Physical Models of Droplet Capture</h2>
With a physical understanding of what masks must create a barrier against, how, specifically, do they block each size regime of droplet?

Here we begin with a model of how a basic mask tackles this problem. The physical idea of a mask as a kind of netting is relatively inaccurate- for instance, using this idea we may guess that the smallest droplets are hardest to stop but it is in fact the medium sized regime that proves most difficult in practise. Let us begin with a measure of how "good" a mask is, or how much COVID-19 it potentially captures. We can define the mask's efficiency, \(E\), as the amount of droplet flow, \(F\) it blocks-
\begin{equation}
    E_{d_{1}-d_{2}}=\frac{F_{behind}}{F_{infront}}\times100\%
\end{equation}
The efficiency will tell us how good the mask is at blocking droplets but it can also be measured over various size ranges of droplet, \(d_{1}-d_{2}\), as each diameter range presents a different challenge.
</br><figure style="text-align:center"><img src="assets\filtration techniques.jpg" style="width:50%; background-color:seashell;"><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">Schematic representing filtration techniques of masks [1]</figcaption></figure>


<b>Gravity sedimentation</b>: For the very largest regime of particles, >1μm, gravity and inertial forces are the dominating force in their trajectory. We understand that any droplets that make it to the mask fibres do not follow the air flow but essentially travel downwards. Cotton fibres have a thickness of 8μm-20m [2] which is comparable to this largest regime, suggesting that collisions with droplets will be extremely likely.
</br>
<b>Inertial impaction</b>: Again for the largest particles, >1μm, we have inertia as a major force. Since inertia is the resistance of the droplet to change its velocity, and velocity includes the direction of the droplet, the air flow around the fibres is again negligible so impact is highly likely. This regime covers the same sizes of droplets as gravity sedimentation but, noting that even these largest droplets can stay in the air for many minutes, we now have a model for >1μm droplets at any velocity.
</br>
<b>Interception</b>: For the other large droplets, 0.6μm-1.0μm, in the largest regime interception is our primary filtration method. The inertia of the droplet is not large enough for the direction to remain unchanged due to air flow but the particle is deflected by less than \(\text{radius}_\text{fibre}-\text{radius}_\text{droplet}\), assuming the initial path of the droplet is towards the centre of the fibre. Essentially, this method is when the droplet is notable deflected, just not by enough to avoid the fibre.
</br>
<b>Diffusion</b>: The smallest regime of droplet, &lt;0.3μm, follows Brownian motion. Due to the random nature of the droplet path, capture is highly likely. If each layer of fibres has a small chance to capture the small droplet, the Brownian motion means that each droplet will go back and forth between fibres, increasing the likelihood of capture. Here we emphasise that initial intuitive thoughts that the smallest particles may be the hardest to filter are wrong. We must also note that the smallest particles are not only captured through chance of hitting a fibre- instead, masks make use of electrostatic attraction.
</br>
<b>Electrostatic attraction</b>: This is a method of filtration that isn't used in common masks but is made use of in medical grade masks. The fibres are very slightly electrically charged, inducing an electric charge in the nearby droplets, hence exerting a force on the droplet towards the fibres.
</br><figure style="text-align:center"><img src="assets\newelectro.jpg" style="width:20%; background-color:seashell;"><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">Diagram representing electrostatic forces</figcaption></figure>


We must realise that the electrostatic force is actually fairly weak and is therefore only effective when the droplets are in the smallest regime, moving slowly and nearby the fibre. Electrostatic attraction works well with diffusion- whilst slightly larger droplets may only be slightly deflected by the charged fibres, droplets colliding with air molecules will be will pass by the fibres many times. This hugely increases the chance of capture,

        <h2>Comparison of selected masks</h2>
In the UK, many different types of masks are available to a consumer. Shortages of surgical masks and Personal Protective Equipment have been worldwide issues throughout the pandemic, and recent studies have highlighted issues with home made or home solution masks- balaclavas, snoods etc. Note: snoods and balaclavas are not a mask and should never be used instead of one. It is important to realise how efficient a mask you need compared to what a front line worker needs. Here, lets examine how the surgical grade N95 mask is made to be much more efficient across all droplet regimes than a typical cotton mask.
</br>

An excellent study into aerosol filtration produced these results showing efficiency for various materials. For the 500nm-10μm droplet sizes, two optical particle counters are used- with one infront of the vacuum pump drawing the particles through the mask and another behind the mask. For the 30nm-250nm droplet sizes, the setup is physically similar with slight technical changes in order to control the charge on the droplets. We can see that the masks are always more effective in capturing small droplets when they are electrostatically charged.
</br><figure style="text-align:center"><img src="assets\2nd graph diagram.jpeg" style="width:50%; background-color:seashell;"><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">Graphs showing the efficiency of various masks over two size ranges of droplet [1]</figcaption></figure>

<b>Cotton mask: </b>A cotton mask will act as a physical barrier to incoming droplets. This type of cloth mask should be noted as a resort only used in unusual circumstance, like the COVID-19 pandemic, as it is relatively inefficient. The stacked fibres perform well when blocking large droplets but will have much less impact on our medium and small sized droplet regimes. Notably, cotton is not electrostatically charged, unlike some synthetic materials.
Van der Waals forces hold any droplets to the fibres once contact is made- this is the same for any droplets size or method of droplet capture. The two types of Ven der Waals forces are the stronger "dipole-dipole interactions" and the weaker "London forces". On the scale of the droplets, the forces of the constituent molecules are no longer negligible. The London forces occur much like our electrostatic forces- a slightly negative side of a molecule induces the nearby side of another molecule to become slightly positive, causing electrostatic attraction. The dipole-dipole interactions are made up of interactions between two permanent dipoles. Some molecules have inbuilt asymmetry to their charge and so are already predisposed to electrostatic attraction with similar molecules.
The efficiency of a single layer cotton mask is roughly 30% for particles in the medium and large regimes and 10% for particles in the smallest regime [1]. It is therefore clear why this type of mask is not suitable for a clinical setting but still will have a noticeable impact on the general spread of COVID-19. Notably, many cotton masks have two layers, increasing efficiency by roughly 40% for all droplet regimes. At first reaction, we may ask why such masks are included in UK government regulations when so ineffective but it is important to realise the mathematics behind COVID-19 spread.
</br>

<b>N95 mask: </b> The N95 mask claims to be 95% effective. Studies have found that the efficiency of the mask can drop below 95% for particularly high flow rates of the medium droplet regime [2] but overall the N95 performs highly, filtering out essentially 100% of small and large droplets. It has three layers of polypropylene which can induce electrostatic charge as the material is suitable for a process called electrospinning, which essentially puts excess charge on the polypropylene fibres.
</br><figure style="text-align:center"><img src="assets\newnewnew.png" style="width:50%; background-color:seashell;"><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">Diagrams showing the N95 layers and material [2]</figcaption></figure>

This type of mask can be used in a hospital setting very successfully as long as the masks are worn correctly. Although perhaps not a widespread issue for trained healthcare workers, the fit of a mask is highly important for a good efficiency. If a mask is not worn to a tight fit droplets can enter through the gaps- an issue compounded by the fact that the space between the mask and you're mouth is a low pressure area whenever you breath in, sucking in even more air from any gaps.

    <div class="sectionA">
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        Mask wearing is particularly relevant in the COVID-19 pandemic due to the high numbers of asymptomatic carriers and an incubation period of a few days before symptoms present themselves. The UK's mask uptake is low compared to similar European countries and has also had an extremely high number of deaths for its population so it is clearly an area in which a renewed public health campaign would be useful.
One particular issue in the UK could be the communication of government regulations- for instance, 20% of adults believed face masks to be compulsory in shops in England, prior to the July 24th 2020 announcement for mask wearing to become compulsory in shops for the first time [1]. Another issue, not just present in the UK, is the significant number of men refusing to wear masks. A study conducted by Middlesex University London found that men were nearly twice as likely to strongly disagree with the statement that they "intend to wear a mask outside their home" [2]. The same study found that the reasoning behind this was that masks are "shameful, not cool and a sign of weakness". Clearly, not every society and not everyone in society has the same view of masks. It is the government's responsibility to promote the use of masks- with such solid scientific evidence that masks reduce the spread of COVID-19 this should not be a contentious issue.
If, however, you remain unconvinced of the effectiveness of a simple cloth mask you may agree that with more people wearing them, more social responsibility will be shown.
