            COVID-19 primarily manifests as pneumonia, occasionally accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. Signs and symptoms of pneumonia such as dry cough, breathlessness and fever, are frequently present. However, recent evidence suggest that the highly pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 affects not only the cardiovascular system, but also has detrimental effects on the nervous system. A preprint presents the results of a 2020 retrospective case series study from in Wuhan, China, finding neurological manifestations in 36.4% of 214 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [1]. There have been reported cases of COVID-19 where the patient experiences neurological symptoms, such as dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness and loss of taste or smell. What is more, neuroimaging has been used to determine acute cerebrovascular disease (various issues with blood flow to the brain), presenting as different types of strokes and brain bleed, and acute necrotizing encephalopathy [1]. Meningitis, swelling of the brain, seizures and acute Guillain-Barré syndrome (which attacks the nervous system) have also been reported [1].  The retrospective case study from the epicentre of Wuhan, using data from special care centres for COVID-19, found that patients had, in addition to typical clinical symptoms, presented with skeletal muscle symptoms, acute cerebrovascular disease, impaired consciousness and nerve pain. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pathophysiology involves both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.         </div>

            <h2>Biophysical Techniques</h2>
            There are several potential mechanisms through which COVID-19 could affect the nervous system[1]. Information provided by studying virus structures using techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography has extensively enriched our understanding of the virus world. Hence, physics-based techniques and structural biology - the study of the structure, dynamics and function of biological macromolecules - play an important role in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 could invade the nervous system. Alexander Wlodawer, head of the micromolecular crystallography laboratory at the US National Cancer Institute states that: “Structural biology has reached the stage where it’s fast enough for almost anything”.

            Dorothy Hodgkin, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1964 “for her determination by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances”[2], observed and recorded the first X-ray diffraction pattern of the crystallized enzyme pepsin with Desmond Bernal in 1934. The methods they used stem from the work of physicists such as William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg who found how to use an X-ray diffraction pattern to analyse the corresponding crystal structure, Wilhelm Röntgen who discovered X-rays and Max von Laue who discovered that inter-atomic distances are comparable with X-ray wavelengths, (all were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics at the beginning of the 20th century).

            <h2>Neuroimaging</h2>
            This is a rather new field using various techniques is neuroimaging or brain imaging. Neuroimaging uses different techniques to produce images of brain structures, including the nervous system.
</br>In the following we will look at some physics-based techniques that have been used to diagnose patients with neurological disorders associated with COVID-19.
</br></br><i>Cerebrovascular disease</i></br>
Disorders in the brain can be onset by a brain bleed or ischemia – restricted blood supply to the brain or blood leaking from a blood vessel, respectively. If the blood supply is reduced or interrupted, cerebral cells do not receive oxygen and nutrients/glucose, leading to cell death within minutes. If circulation is not re-established, some neural brain tissue will liquify and become viscous. This loss of neurons and neurological cells is irreversible. To attempt to minimize the effects, acute altered mental status and level of consciousness as well as signs of rapid onset neurologic deficit, must be examined. Therefore, neuroimaging is immensely valuable for diagnosing the patient. A computed tomography (CT) conveys to what extent an x-ray beam is absorbed in a small volume in the brain using a computer program. The result of such a CT-scan is typically presented as cross-sections of the brain:
<figure style="text-align:center"><img src="assets\brain.png" style="width:40%; background-color:seashell;"><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">Unenhanced CT image of the brain of a patient with stroke. 1: arrowhead showing blurring of the grey matter-white conjunction. 2:<b>MISSING</b></figcaption></figure>
Cell death affects half of all patients with manifested complications within 24 hours of the stroke occurring. Such neurologic deterioration acutely manifests as damage to surrounding tissues inside the brain, brain swelling, bleeding from small blood vessels, a collection of blood outside the blood vessels, seizures and death[4].

</br></br><i>Encephalopathy</i> </br>
COVID-19 has been associated with the rare central nervous system complication acute necrotizing encephalopathy. The cerebrospinal fluid of a female diagnosed with COVID-19 after the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using a Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay, was tested for viruses such as herpes and West Nile virus. The tests were negative. However, unenhanced CT of the head of the female demonstrated symmetric low attenuation (intensity) of ovoid cerebral structures (grey matter) shown with arrows (figure above:1). The thalami participate is responsible for the regulation of consciousness and alertness, as well as the relaying of motor and sensory signals.

</br></br><i>Functional Neuroimaging and Post-COVID-19 Syndromes</i> </br>
In the light of frequently reported post-COVID-19 neurological syndromes, neuroimaging can be a useful tool for researching neurocognitive and neuropsychological functioning. Furthermore, it is undeniable that those suffering critical illness are at risk of experiencing more severe long-term cognitive impairment[5]. In addition, COVID-19 is undoubtedly a significant psychological stressor. Functional imaging, a form of neuroimaging, enables a direct visualization of the processing of information by specific parts of the brain. The area that is processing the information acquires increasing metabolism, which makes it “light up” on the scan. Thus, neuroimaging may also assist in the treatment of post-COVID altered neuropsychological functioning.

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            It is undeniable that SARS-CoV-2 has neurological effects. The use of medical physics during this global pandemic, such as neuroimaging, cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, have proved to be useful tools in understanding COVID-19 and its neurological implications. The use of structural biology and biophysical methods provides more research evidence and will therefore expand medical professionals’ knowledge upon encountering the virus. Similarly, COVID-19 related findings using imaging techniques will enable a greater collation of research and so will improve the overall diagnostic confidence of the medical community. Finally, the nature of COVID-19 requires the use of medical physics, including neuroimaging and the application of physics and mathematics to problems in medicine and human biology.
