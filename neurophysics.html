            COVID-19 primarily manifests as pneumonia, occasionally accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. Signs and symptoms of pneumonia such as dry cough, breathlessness and fever, are frequently present. However, recent evidence suggest that the highly pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 affects not only the cardiovascular system, but also has detrimental effects on the nervous system. A preprint presents the results of a 2020 retrospective case series study from in Wuhan, China, finding neurological manifestations in 36.4% of 214 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [1]. There have been reported cases of COVID-19 where the patient experiences neurological symptoms, such as dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness and loss of taste or smell. What is more, neuroimaging has been used to determine acute cerebrovascular disease (various issues with blood flow to the brain), presenting as different types of strokes and brain bleed, and acute necrotizing encephalopathy [2]. Meningitis, swelling of the brain, seizures and acute Guillain-Barré syndrome (which attacks the nervous system) have also been reported [3].  The retrospective case study from the epicentre of Wuhan, using data from special care centres for COVID-19, found that patients had, in addition to typical clinical symptoms, presented with skeletal muscle symptoms, acute cerebrovascular disease, impaired consciousness and nerve pain. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 pathophysiology involves both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.         </div>

            <h2>Biophysical Techniques</h2>
            There are several potential mechanisms through which COVID-19 could affect the nervous system[4]. Information provided by studying virus structures using techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography has extensively enriched our understanding of the virus world. Hence, physics-based techniques and structural biology - the study of the structure, dynamics and function of biological macromolecules - play an important role in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 could invade the nervous system. Alexander Wlodawer, head of the micromolecular crystallography laboratory at the US National Cancer Institute states that: “Structural biology has reached the stage where it’s fast enough for almost anything”.
        </br></br>
        <b>X-ray Crystallography</b></br>


            Dorothy Hodgkin, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1964 “for her determination by X-ray techniques of the structures of important biochemical substances”[5], observed and recorded the first X-ray diffraction pattern of the crystallized enzyme pepsin with Desmond Bernal in 1934. The methods they used stem from the work of physicists such as William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg who found how to use an X-ray diffraction pattern to analyse the corresponding crystal structure, Wilhelm Röntgen who discovered X-rays and Max von Laue who discovered that inter-atomic distances are comparable with X-ray wavelengths, (all were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics at the beginning of the 20th century).

X-ray crystallography yields information about crystal structure. It is used to obtain biological macromolecule structures and is the most powerful approach to determining virus structures at close to atomic resolutions. X-rays scattered in a crystal produces a diffraction pattern, as illustrated below.         <figure style="text-align:center"><img src="assets\8cc462f7de4887befce7ce95b32109ec.png" style="width:30%; background-color:seashell;"><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">Diffraction grating - X-ray diffraction through a crystallised molecule.</figcaption></figure>

Biological molecules diffract X-rays, but poorly. Hodgkin and Bernal employed crystallisation of the enzyme pepsin. Crystallisation enables the small signals of diffracted X-rays from different parts of the molecule to reinforce each other as a crystal essentially is a large number of its constituents ordered in a 3D lattice. Following, calculations and careful interpretation can reveal atomic structures. Furthermore, such collection of data and crystallisation is automated today. Therefore, on the 5th of February 2020, a research team at ShanghaiTech University uploaded the structure of SARS-CoV-2 main enzyme that breaks down protein[6], to the Protein Data Bank. At the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, they had used X-ray crystallography to obtain a dataset. Pharmaceutical companies are currently exploring potential drugs using that structure.     </br></br>
    <b>Cryo-EM</b></br>
    Modern techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy has provided information that have widened and shaped our vision of the virus world[7]. Cryo-EM has the ability to locate individual atoms within a protein and enables identifying viral structures almost immediately. Directly observing macromolecules in much detail have been crucial for several scientific advances. Cryo-EM can be used to visualise atomic structures of components in human disease. For example, it has been used to obtain the structure of viruses responsible for the hand, foot, and mouth disease epidemics[8]. The technique has been utilized for decades but have been gaining increasing interest since the “resolution revolution”[9], when algorithmic and technological advances improved the obtainable resolution around 2013. A structural biologist at the University of Oxford and director of life sciences at the Diamond Light Source, David Stuart, obtained one of the first viral structures that was deposited in the Protein Data Bank. He stresses techniques have progressed significantly: “Getting those first structures, that was a big deal!”. Daniel Wrapp and Nianshuang Wang with others at the University of Texas at Austin obtained the structure of an outer “spike” protein of SARS-CoV-2 using cryo-EM[10]. They harvested the structure of the outer spike protein that is believed to be the key to “opening the door” into host cells for SARS-CoV-2 in the end of March 2020. Notably, this process, including writing a paper, only took 12 days. A fellow author of the paper, Jason McLellan from the University of Texas at Austin, has stated: “Without cryo-EM, it may not have been possible at all.”

            <h2>Neuroimaging</h2>
            <figure style="text-align:center"><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/AchingViciousBernesemountaindog' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='320' height='342' class="gif"> </iframe><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">Neuroimaging of the brain using fMRI</figcaption></figure>

A rather new field using techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), is neuroimaging, or brain imaging, and could contribute to increased understanding of multiple risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 and the development of COVID-19. Neuroimaging produces images of brain structures, including the nervous system. In the following we will look at how some of these physics-based techniques are being used to diagnose patients with neurological disorders associated with COVID-19.
</br>In the following we will look at some physics-based techniques that have been used to diagnose patients with neurological disorders associated with COVID-19.
</br></br><i>Cerebrovascular disease</i></br>
Disorders in the brain can be onset by ischemia or brain bleed – restricted blood supply to the brain or blood leaking from a blood vessel, respectively. Risk factors associated with COVID-19 could contribute to increased severity of these disorders. If the blood supply is reduced or interrupted, cerebral cells do not receive oxygen and nutrients, leading to cell death. If circulation is not re-established, neural brain tissue can for example liquify and become viscous or coagulate. Such loss of neurons and neurological cells is irreversible. Below necrotic tissue is seen on the right side of the photo to the left and below the line in the photo to the right. The necrotic tissue clearly has fever cells.
<figure style="text-align:center"><img src="assets\Picturea.jpg" style="width:31%;display:inline; background-color:seashell;"><img src="assets\Pictureb.jpg" style="width:30%;display:inline; background-color:seashell;"><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">Example of cell and neuron death in the brain. Coagulative like neuronal necrosis. The blue line separates healthy and dying cells.</figcaption></figure>
Neuroimaging is extremely valuable in diagnosing a patient. Cell death affects half of all patients with manifested complications within 24 hours of the stroke occurring. Such neurologic deterioration acutely manifests as damage to surrounding tissues inside the brain, brain swelling, bleeding from small blood vessels, a collection of blood outside the blood vessels, seizures and death[11]. Early diagnosis of stroke is important to prevent cell and nerve death and can be done using computed tomography (CT). To attempt to minimize the effects, acute altered mental status and level of consciousness as well as signs of rapid onset neurologic deficit, must be examined. A CT conveys to what extent an X-ray beam is absorbed in a small volume in the brain using a computer program and can consequently identify blockages of vessels in the brain. The result of such a CT-scan is typically presented as cross-sections of the brain. The images below show neuroimaging features of COVID-19-associated stroke[12].
<figure style="text-align:center"><img src="assets\Picturec.png" style="width:20%;display:inline; background-color:seashell;"><img src="assets\Pictured.png" style="width:19.5%;display:inline; background-color:seashell;"><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">A: Brain CT of a patient with acute symptoms. Shows lesion in the middle left cerebral artery.</br>B: CT showing multiple lesions in the brain of a man with COVID-19 infection.</figcaption></figure>
</br></br><i>Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy </i> </br>
COVID-19 has been associated with the rare central nervous system complication acute necrotizing encephalopathy[13][14]. Acute necrotising encephalopathy is rare but can occur following the infection of a virus. It has been related to an immune response, called cytokine storm, which can break down the barrier between the blood and the brain. If this barrier is broken, the virus can enter the fluid in the brain where neurons reside. Moreover, this type of encephalopathy is often characterised “by multiple bilateral brain lesions, mainly involving the thalami”[15].
</br>
A female diagnosed with COVID-19 after the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019 Novel Coronavirus Real-Time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction Assay, reported having some clinical symptoms and altered mental status. Her cerebrospinal fluid was tested for other viruses such as herpes simplex 1 and 2 and West Nile virus. The tests for other viruses than SARS-CoV-2 were negative. Next, MRI images of her brain would demonstrate hyperintensity within the bilateral medial temporal lobes and thalami. Hyperintensity reflect lesions.
<figure style="text-align:center"><img src="assets\Picture5.jpg" style="width:19.75%;display:inline; background-color:seashell;"><img src="assets\Picture6.jpg" style="width:20%;display:inline; background-color:seashell;"><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">MRI images demonstrating hyperintensity within the bilateral medial temporal lobes and thalami, see arrows.</figcaption></figure>
The bilateral medial temporal lobes play an important role for memory and the deposit of information, whilst the thalami participate in the regulation of consciousness and alertness, and the relaying of motor and sensory signals, amongst other functions. Evidently, these MRI images suggest a connection between the onset of neurological symptoms and infection with SARS-CoV-2.

</br></br><i>Functional Neuroimaging and Post-COVID-19 Syndromes</i> </br>
In the light of frequently reported post-COVID-19 neurological syndromes, neuroimaging can be a useful tool for researching neurocognitive and neuropsychological functioning. Furthermore, it is undeniable that those suffering critical illness are at risk of experiencing more severe long-term cognitive impairment[16]. In addition, COVID-19 is undoubtedly a significant psychological stressor. Functional imaging, a form of neuroimaging, enables a direct visualization of the processing of information by specific parts of the brain. The area that is processing the information acquires increasing metabolism, which makes it “light up” on the scan.
Methods of functional imaging include functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI).
<figure style="text-align:center"><iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/SourCreamyFantail' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' allowfullscreen width='320' height='276' class="gif"></iframe><figcaption style="opacity:0.5; font-size:12px;">Neuroimaging of the brain using fMRI</figcaption></figure>
The GIF shows an fMRI scan of the brain. fMRI uses the method blood-oxygen-level-dependent imaging in order to produce its imaging. It poses little risk because it is none-invasive. The method exploits the naturally occurring contrast between active and inactive neurons. Active neurons require more oxygen, and as a consequence, increased or decrease activity is indicated by colours. The red, orange and yellow areas show an increase in neuron activity and exhibit the involved parts of the brain. Clearly, neuroimaging may also assist in the treatment of post-COVID neuropsychiatric sequalae and altered neuropsychological functioning.

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
It is undeniable that SARS-CoV-2 has neurological effects. The use of medical physics during this global pandemic, such as neuroimaging, cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, have proved to be useful tools in understanding COVID-19 and its neurological implications. The use of structural biology and biophysical methods provides more research evidence, consequently expanding medical professionals’ knowledge upon encountering SARS-CoV-2. Too, this can lead to further technological developments that can spur vaccine creation and development. Similarly, COVID-19 related findings using neuroimaging techniques allows more collation of research within this field and consequently improve the overall diagnostic confidence of the medical community. Finally, the dire nature of COVID-19 requires the use of medical physics, including neuroimaging and the application of physics to problems in medicine and human biology.          </div>
