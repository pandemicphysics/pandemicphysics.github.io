            <div class="splash-text">The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on all, not least felt in the medical community. Behind mass testing, masks, government briefings and statistics, there are many medical physicists pushing forward new areas of research and helping us in these times.
</br></br>
The role of the physicist in this pandemic is vital and something we believed deserved to be highlighted. Through our website, you can learn about how physics relates to the pandemic: from the medical detail of testing and Neurobiophysics, through to the mathematical models used to create suitable public guidelines, guidelines such as compulsory mask wearing, requiring communication of COVID-19 statistics.
</br></br>
We hope to have provided an interesting insight into the diverse work carried out by the medical physics community during the pandemic, giving an opportunity to explore more about the science of COVID-19.

            Several areas have been of particular interest in terms of academic research related to the pandemic, and the medical physics aspect of the scientific response is of particular interest to us. Medical physics is simply the term used to describe physics that can be used to treat, diagnose and gain understanding of issues within the field of medicine and medical physics has also proven highly useful in combating COVID-19.
</br></br>
Our statistical models of the spread of COVID-19 have guided governments in their approach to COVID-19 measures. An understanding of the now well known 'R number' requires an appreciation of the exponential function and the mathematics of disease spread. The general public's understanding of COVID-19 is strongly influenced by government briefings, which make heavy use of statistical data.
</br></br>
Our understanding of common physical processes has overseen successful mass testing for COVID-19. Only when we know the details of how each test works can we decide which is appropriate for this pandemic- mass testing is clearly required but how far can we sacrifice sensitivity? The future of disease testing, not only for COVID-19, is of particular interest- with CT scanning and use of neural networks as particularly fast-moving research topics.
</br></br>
 A consideration of how droplet motion governs the design of masks seems particularly relevant with the knowledge that COVID-19 predominantly spreads through the air. A surprising range of common physical concepts help explain droplet motion- from intuitive Newtonian mechanics, to electromagnetism, to statistical models of random motion common in thermodynamics.
</br></br>
 Medical physics isn't only constrained to prevention and diagnosis: post-COVID-19 syndrome, or 'long COVID', has shown us that everyone in society can be vulnerable to lengthy and serious health problems. The impacts these have on the brain and nervous system can also be seen through sophisticated imaging techniques and with the application of biophysics.
</br></br>
 Why should we seek to gain an understanding of these specific medical physics areas in relation to COVID-19? It is paramount that the necessity of these reactions to the pandemic is widely understood. Medical physics can give us an insight into how and why certain measures are successful in stemming the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the potential medical physics holds in saving lives and reducing the socioeconomic fallout of the pandemic makes an appreciation of the underlying physical concepts of the fight against COVID-19 highly rewarding.         </div>
