Since the first UK cases of COVID-19 at the end of 2019, the government has faced a constant challenge- adapting to difficult internal affairs decisions, tumultuous international politics and the overarching task of keeping cases and deaths low. Many initial factors strongly influence how well a country responds to the pandemic, but it is clear that the UK started in an excellent position- with strong borrowing power, strong scientific infrastructure  and an internationally admired health service. However, across all measures, the UK excess death rate from COVID-19 has been one of the worst worldwide [1]. Whilst this may be an issue more suited to discussion within the political arena, it is evident that the UK scientific community, alongside government, has played an key role in the response. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) has guided government action and numerous universities have worked to give reliable disease spread models, to develop vaccines and to further our understanding of mitigation techniques for COVID-19. Therefore, it would be unfair to characterise the COVID-19 response as a wholly political one: rather, it is an eclectic response alongside numerous scientific areas, not least medical physics.

            A number of areas have been of particular interest in terms of academic research related to the pandemic. As of 2021, vaccines are by far the most prominent but there are many others. For instance, the medical physics aspect of the scientific response is of particular interest. Medical physics is simply the term used to describe physics that can be used to treat, diagnose and gain understanding of issues within the field of medicine. Radiation treatment for cancer and X-ray imaging are particularly well known examples but medical physics has also proven highly useful in combating COVID-19. Here, certain areas of relevant medical physics are explained and the success of their implementations analysed.
</br></br>
Our statistical models of the spread of COVID-19 have guided governments in their approach to COVID-19 measures and UK lockdown. An understanding of the now well known 'R number' requires an appreciation of the exponential function and the mathematics of disease spread. The general public's understanding of COVID-19 is strongly influenced by government briefings, which make heavy use of statistical data. Data presentation and scientific communication are key tools for any government attempting to persuade the public of the necessity of COVID-19 measures: If not presented accurately and consistently this, alongside misinformation, can shape trust between the public and the government in dangerous ways.
</br></br>
Our understanding of common physical processes has overseen successful mass testing for COVID-19. Lateral Flow Tests can only be understood with a knowledge of capillary flow and surface tension, whilst other diagnostic methods use far more sensitive enzyme reactions. Only when we know the details of how each test works can we decide which is appropriate for this pandemic- mass testing is clearly required but how far can we sacrifice sensitivity? The future of disease testing, not only for COVID-19, is of particular interest- with CT scanning and use of neural networks as particularly fast moving research topics.
</br></br>
A consideration of how droplet motion governs the design of masks seems particularly relevant with the knowledge that COVID-19 predominantly spreads through the air [2]. Additionally, with a multitude of masks available to the public, me must also understand why different types of masks are more effective than others. A surprising range of common physical concepts help explain droplet motion- from intuitive Newtonian mechanics, to electromagnetism, to statistical models of random motion common in thermodynamics. Why is it that mask wearing is a necessity for the socially responsible, helping stop the spread of COVID-19?
</br></br>
Medical physics isn't only constrained to prevention and diagnosis: post-COVID-19 syndrome, or 'long COVID', has shown us that everyone in society can be vulnerable to lengthy and serious health problems [3]. Here, physical concepts aid our understanding of (CUT THIS IF NO MATERIAL)
</br></br>
Why should we seek to gain an understanding of these specific medical physics areas in relation to COVID-19? It seems clear that the public's response to the pandemic is by no means a simple affair. Whilst keeping ourselves and others safe through social distancing, mask wearing and following government rules has been everyone's concern for an extended period of time, it is paramount that the necessity of these reactions to the pandemic is widely understood and believed in. Medical physics can give us an insight into how and why certain measures are successful in stemming the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the potential medical physics holds in saving lives and reducing the socioeconomic fallout of the pandemic makes an appreciation of the underlying physical concepts of the fight against COVID-19 highly rewarding.
